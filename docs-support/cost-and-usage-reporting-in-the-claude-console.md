### Rate Limit Use

The Usage page also includes a separate section displaying rate limit use per-model for input and output tokens. You can click the dropdown in the upper left corner of this section to change the model and view related rate limit metrics. These visualizations can be used to determine when you’re hitting peak use for your organization, which specific rate limits need to be increased, and how you can increase your caching rate.

 

**Rate Limit Use + Caching - Input Tokens: **This chart displays the hourly maximum number of uncached input tokens per minute (ITPM) alongside your cache rate (i.e. the percentage of input tokens read from the cache) and your current ITPM rate limit. 

 

**Rate Limit Use - Output Tokens: **This chart displays the hourly maximum number of output tokens per minute (OTPM) alongside your current OTPM rate limit.
