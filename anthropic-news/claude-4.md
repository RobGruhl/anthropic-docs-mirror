Today, we’re introducing the next generation of Claude models:Claude Opus 4andClaude Sonnet 4, setting new standards for coding, advanced reasoning, and AI agents.

Claude Opus 4 is the world’s best coding model, with sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows. Claude Sonnet 4 is a significant upgrade to Claude Sonnet 3.7, delivering superior coding and reasoning while responding more precisely to your instructions.

Alongside the models, we're also announcing:

- Extended thinking with tool use (beta): Both models can use tools—likeweb search—during extended thinking, allowing Claude to alternate between reasoning and tool use to improve responses.

- New model capabilities: Both models can use tools in parallel, follow instructions more precisely, and—when given access to local files by developers—demonstrate significantly improved memory capabilities, extracting and saving key facts to maintain continuity and build tacit knowledge over time.

- Claude Code is now generally available: After receiving extensive positive feedback during our research preview, we’re expanding how developers can collaborate with Claude. Claude Code now supports background tasks via GitHub Actions and native integrations with VS Code and JetBrains, displaying edits directly in your files for seamless pair programming.

- New API capabilities:We’re releasingfour new capabilitieson our API that enable developers to build more powerful AI agents: the code execution tool, MCP connector, Files API, and the ability to cache prompts for up to one hour.

Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 are hybrid models offering two modes: near-instant responses and extended thinking for deeper reasoning. The Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise Claude plans include both models and extended thinking, with Sonnet 4 also available to free users. Both models are available on our API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud's Vertex AI. Pricing remains consistent with previous Opus and Sonnet models: Opus 4 at $15/$75 per million tokens (input/output) and Sonnet 4 at $3/$15.

## Claude 4

Claude Opus 4 is our most powerful model yet and the best coding model in the world, leading on SWE-bench (72.5%) and Terminal-bench (43.2%). It delivers sustained performance on long-running tasks that require focused effort and thousands of steps, with the ability to work continuously for several hours—dramatically outperforming all Sonnet models and significantly expanding what AI agents can accomplish.

## Model improvements

In addition to extended thinking with tool use, parallel tool execution, and memory improvements, we’ve significantly reduced behavior where the models use shortcuts or loopholes to complete tasks. Both models are 65% less likely to engage in this behavior than Sonnet 3.7 on agentic tasks that are particularly susceptible to shortcuts and loopholes.

Claude Opus 4 also dramatically outperforms all previous models on memory capabilities. When developers build applications that provide Claude local file access, Opus 4 becomes skilled at creating and maintaining 'memory files' to store key information. This unlocks better long-term task awareness, coherence, and performance on agent tasks—like Opus 4 creating a 'Navigation Guide' while playing Pokémon.

Finally, we've introduced thinking summaries for Claude 4 models that use a smaller model to condense lengthy thought processes. This summarization is only needed about 5% of the time—most thought processes are short enough to display in full.

## Claude Code

Claude Code, now generally available, brings the power of Claude to more of your development workflow—in the terminal, your favorite IDEs, and running in the background with the Claude Code SDK.

New beta extensions for VS Code and JetBrains integrate Claude Code directly into your IDE. Claude’s proposed edits appear inline in your files, streamlining review and tracking within the familiar editor interface. Simply run Claude Code in your IDE terminal to install.

Beyond the IDE, we're releasing an extensible Claude Code SDK, so you can build your own agents and applications using the same core agent as Claude Code. We're also releasing an example of what's possible with the SDK: Claude Code on GitHub, now in beta. Tag Claude Code on PRs to respond to reviewer feedback, fix CI errors, or modify code. To install, run /install-github-app from within Claude Code.

#### Performance benchmark reporting

Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 are hybrid reasoning models. The benchmarks reported in this blog post show the highest scores achieved with or without extended thinking. We’ve noted below for each result whether extended thinking was used:

- No extended thinking: SWE-bench Verified, Terminal-bench

- Extended thinking (up to 64K tokens):TAU-bench (no results w/o extended thinking reported)GPQA Diamond (w/o extended thinking: Opus 4 scores 74.9% and Sonnet 4 is 70.0%)MMMLU (w/o extended thinking: Opus 4 scores 87.4% and Sonnet 4 is 85.4%)MMMU (w/o extended thinking: Opus 4 scores 73.7% and Sonnet 4 is 72.6%)AIME (w/o extended thinking: Opus 4 scores 33.9% and Sonnet 4 is 33.1%)

- TAU-bench (no results w/o extended thinking reported)

- GPQA Diamond (w/o extended thinking: Opus 4 scores 74.9% and Sonnet 4 is 70.0%)

- MMMLU (w/o extended thinking: Opus 4 scores 87.4% and Sonnet 4 is 85.4%)

- MMMU (w/o extended thinking: Opus 4 scores 73.7% and Sonnet 4 is 72.6%)

- AIME (w/o extended thinking: Opus 4 scores 33.9% and Sonnet 4 is 33.1%)

#### TAU-bench methodology

Scores were achieved with a prompt addendum to both the Airline and Retail Agent Policy instructing Claude to better leverage its reasoning abilities while using extended thinking with tool use. The model is encouraged to write down its thoughts as it solves the problem distinct from our usual thinking mode, during the multi-turn trajectories to best leverage its reasoning abilities. To accommodate the additional steps Claude incurs by utilizing more thinking, the maximum number of steps (counted by model completions) was increased from 30 to 100 (most trajectories completed under 30 steps with only one trajectory reaching above 50 steps).

#### SWE-bench methodology

For the Claude 4 family of models, we continue to use the same simple scaffold that equips the model with solely the two tools described in our prior releases[here](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/swe-bench-sonnet)—a bash tool, and a file editing tool that operates via string replacements. We no longer include the[third ‘planning tool’](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool)used by Claude 3.7 Sonnet. On all Claude 4 models, we report scores out of the full 500 problems. Scores for OpenAI models are reported out of a[477 problem subset](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-1/).

For our “high compute” numbers we adopt additional complexity and parallel test-time compute as follows:

- We sample multiple parallel attempts.

- We discard patches that break the visible regression tests in the repository, similar to the rejection sampling approach adopted byAgentless (Xia et al. 2024); note no hidden test information is used.

- We then use an internal scoring model to select the best candidate from the remaining attempts.

This results in a score of 79.4% and 80.2% for Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 respectively.
